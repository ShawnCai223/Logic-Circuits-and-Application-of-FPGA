The clock pin LFSR_reg[2]_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin LFSR_reg[3]_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell LFSR_reg[0]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) LFSR_reg[0]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell LFSR_reg[0]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) LFSR_reg[0]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell LFSR_reg[1]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) LFSR_reg[1]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell LFSR_reg[1]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) LFSR_reg[1]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#5 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell LFSR_reg[2]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) LFSR_reg[2]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#6 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell LFSR_reg[2]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) LFSR_reg[2]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#7 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell LFSR_reg[3]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) LFSR_reg[3]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#8 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell LFSR_reg[3]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) LFSR_reg[3]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LFSR_reg[0]_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LFSR_reg[0]_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LFSR_reg[1]_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LFSR_reg[1]_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LFSR_reg[2]_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LFSR_reg[2]_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LFSR_reg[3]_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LFSR_reg[3]_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
